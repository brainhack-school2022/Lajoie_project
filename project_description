In the present project, we address the research question on whether young adult individuals present differences in the pattern of rs-fMRI functional
connectivity within the language network based on their sex. To address this issue, we propose to determine whether we can distinguish healthy young 
adult men and women, based on their rs-fMRI functional connectivity profile within the language network. The rs-fMRI images will be issued from the 
human connectome project (HCP) S1200 release datatbase (Van Essen et al., 2012). The rs-fMRI images of a total of 667 healthy adults (322 men and 345 women, age: 22-35 years) will be included in the study. 

First, for each participant, we will extract the functional connectivity networks anchored in the core regions of the language network from rs-fMRI data. Then,we will then test whether machine learning models can accurately classify men and women based on their functional connectivity language maps within the language network. Subsequently, we will determine which are the most discriminant functional connectivity features that allow the classification.
